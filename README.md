# CHAPTER_2
## Creating a Hello World App

In this chapter, I focus on creating my first Hello World application, a significant step in building my Mobile app development. This simple yet foundational project introduces me to the process of setting up a Flutter app, working with widgets, styling the user interface, and leveraging Flutter's unique features like hot reload.

To begin, I start by creating a new Flutter project using the command flutter create hello_world. This generates a structured project with all the necessary files. I navigate into the project directory and open it in my preferred development environment, such as Visual Studio Code. Running the default app ensures that my development setup is correctly configured, laying a solid foundation for the project.

Next, I modify the generated app to display a customized Hello World message that reflects my unique touch as a developer. In the lib/main.dart file, I replace the default code with a MaterialApp that includes a Scaffold widget. Using a Center widget to align a Text widget, I proudly display "Hello World â€“ By Leo A. Gabrino" at the center of the screen, demonstrating my understanding of Flutter's widget tree and hierarchy.

Throughout the process, I utilize Flutter's hot reload feature to see the immediate impact of my code changes. This powerful tool allows me to experiment with different styles and layouts, enabling rapid iteration and creativity. I explore various design elements by customizing the theme of the app, adjusting colors, fonts, and text styles to match my personal branding.

This chapter also highlights the importance of understanding StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget. For this project, I use a StatelessWidget as the content is static. However, I take the opportunity to study StatefulWidget, preparing for scenarios where dynamic UI updates might be required in future projects.

By completing this chapter, I have not only created a functional Hello World application but also taken a significant step in building my Mobile Application
